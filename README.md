*Values are obviously fluxuated, I didn't spend 200 days of a year in vscode*

## Functionality
The extension functions similar to WakaTime, and is based off of Spotify Wrapped. 

Each minute, the extension will check if you wrote any new code, if so, it'll give you an extra minute towards your statistics, which can be viewed any time by clicking the present button on the side of your screen.
